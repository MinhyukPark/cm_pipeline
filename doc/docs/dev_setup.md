# For Developers

## Loading a Developer Environment

To quickly set up a developer environment for the CM++ Pipeline, simply run the following commands. (**NOTE: Make sure you have Conda installed**)

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate 
```

## Customizing the Pipeline

- The CM++ Pipeline also allows for users to add their own pipeline stages and clustering methods.
- See the following tutorial for adding new stages and algorithms to the pipeline:
